## Abstract
Two-photon light sheet microscopy has a wide range of applications in biology. Here we report on a novel open-source design to transform a brightfield microscope into a 1P \& 2P light-sheet microscope that offers state-of-the-art imaging resolution and speed. The use of a broadband hollow core fiber for laser delivery enables the sharing of the pulsed laser source with other setups, thus largely reducing the effective cost of this system. 





## BUILDING INSTRUCTIONS:

Here we provide a comprehensive online tutorial that features step-by-step building instructions along with 3D animations, illustrations of the construction process, detailed information on the underlying physical principles, and rationale for components selection. In conjunction with the availability of commercially accessible and connectorized broadband optical fiber, our aim is to promote greater accessibility and affordability in the field of multiphoton light-sheet microscopy. To access this online resource, please follow the links provided below: 

1. [Build first a multicolor one-photon version of the microscope](1P_Multicolor_System.md) with fiber delivery of lasers in the visible spectrum with a standard single-mode optical fiber technology.

2. [Upgrade the one-photon unit into a two-photon system](2P-Upgrade.md) by exploiting advanced hollow core fiber technology.
