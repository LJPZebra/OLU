<!---  # An Open Source 1P and 2P miniDSPIM with broadband fiber based laser delivery    --->

## Abstract
Two-photon light sheet microscopy has a wide range of applications in biology. Here we report a novel open source design to transform a standard microscope into a 1P \& 2P light-sheet microscope. A specially designed broadband hollow core fiber shares the expansive pulsed laser source from other setups. The system provides uncompromised image resolution and speed and makes this technology widely accessible at reduced cost.

The unit is attached to the motorized stage of the system that moves the objective.

(d) Near and far field profile of the fiber output at 515nm and 1030nm laser wavelength. (e) Schematic of the fiber with its FC/PC connectorization and the lens to increase the numerical aperture (NA) to match the NA of the collimation objective (Obj1 in a). (f) Measured light-sheet profile. (g) Single layers of a volumetric brain scan recorded in one- and two-photon mode of a 6dpf old zebrafish larva expressing pan-neuronally GCaMP6f and localized to the cell nucleus (Elav3-H2B-GCaMP6f).

## BUILDING INSTRUCTIONS:

We provide here a comprehensive online tutorial that features step-by-step builtding instructions with 3D animations, illustrations of the construction process, detailed information on the underlying physical principles, and rationale for component selection. This tutorial, combined with the availability of the commercially connectorized broadband optical fiber, aims to enhance the accessibility and affordability of multiphoton light-sheet microscopy. The following two links give access to this online materia:

1. [Build first a multicolor one-photon version of the microscope](1P_Multicolor_System.md) with fiber delivery of lasers in the visible spectrum with a standard single mode optical fiber technology.

2. [Upgrade the one-photon unit into a two-photon system](2P-Upgrade.md) by exploiting advanced hollow core fiber technology.
