#### Let's start to assemble

The two-photon unit is basically identical in its design to the 1P-Multiphoton light-sheet unit. So please follow the detailed instructions given there by taking into account the following modifications: 

(3) As [collimination and illumination objectives](https://www.olympus-lifescience.com/modules/pdfgen/pdfmaker/en_pdf-export_objectives.7efd53eb1e8b4d509bc1bbe2184a7e28/LMPLN5XIR.pdf?rev=1615725199) (Olympus LMPLN5xIR) we use an objective optimized for near infrared transmission. Eventhough not optimized for visible wavelength we can use the same objective also for one-photon imaging later.

(1) Purchase a blue 488nm and a green 5??nm [laser with prealigned fiber coupler](https://github.com/vbormuth/OLU/files/9057780/WEBSITE-Datasheet-LBX-488.pdf)

(2) To combine the two lasers into a single mode fiber attach the two inputs of the [fiber optic coupler](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=TW470R5F2) to the FC/PC connector of each laser. The blue and the green lasers will be combined and are available at both output fiber ports. 

(3) Start assembling the light-sheet unit
* Fix the [collimation objective](https://www.micro-shop.zeiss.com/en/us/shop/objectives/420330-9901-000/Objective-EC-Plan-Neofluar-5x-0.16-M27) to the cube.
