# Our broad band hollow core fiber for pulse laser delivery

## Historical background
Efficient, dispersion-free, and broadband fiber coupling of a two-photon laser source is a long-standing challenge in the field of two-photon microscopy ([Helmchen et al., 2011](http://cshprotocols.cshlp.org/content/2013/10/pdb.top078147.long)) and of fiber optics design ([Wang et al., 2013](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/high-power-laser-science-and-engineering/article/hollowcore-photonic-crystal-fibre-for-high-power-laser-beam-delivery/8D2851845D043DA937A93F431D9F9D9C)). The difficulty arises from the fact that standard single-mode optical glass fibers are associated with strong linear and non-linear pulse dispersion, which reduces the two-photon efficiency. Pre-compensation methods are only efficient at low laser powers and are therefore impractical in the context of fast volumetric two-photon imaging, which requires high photonic fluxes. 

The development of single-mode photonic bandgap fibers, in which the light travels through an air filled hollow core, dramatically reduce dispersion and nonlinear effects and achieve transmission ratios greater than 50% ([Wang et al., 2013](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/high-power-laser-science-and-engineering/article/hollowcore-photonic-crystal-fibre-for-high-power-laser-beam-delivery/8D2851845D043DA937A93F431D9F9D9C), [Cregan et al., 1999](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.285.5433.1537)). These fibers have been successfully used for pulsed laser delivery in the context of multiphoton imaging ([Tai et al., 2004](https://opg.optica.org/abstract.cfm?URI=oe-12-25-6122), [Flusberg et al., 2005](https://opg.optica.org/abstract.cfm?URI=ol-30-17-2272), [Engelbrecht et al., 2008](https://opg.optica.org/abstract.cfm?URI=oe-16-8-5556), [Piyawattanametha et al,. 2009](https://opg.optica.org/abstract.cfm?&uri=ol-34-15-2309), [Choi et al., 2014](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep06626)). However, as the light guiding mechanism is based on the creation of an optical bandgap, these fibers only allow single wavelength transmission and are currently only commercially available for laser wavelengths of 800 nm or 1064 nm (NTK photonics). However, with the rapidly growing collections of genetically encoded actuators and sensors, broadband fiber delivery of the near infrared spectrum and optimally extended to visible wavelengths, is a prerequisite to take full advantage of 2P-LSFM in all possible applications while enabling laser source sharing between different setups.

Broadband fiber delivery spanning the visible and the near-infrared spectrum is possible with negative curvature hollow-core photonic crystal fibers (NCF), which do not rely on an optical bandgap for light-confinement ([Yu et al., 2016](https://opg.optica.org/abstract.cfm?URI=oe-24-12-12969), [Pryamikov et al., 2011](https://opg.optica.org/abstract.cfm?URI=oe-19-2-1441), [Yu et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.20.011153)). The simplest cross-sectional geometry of an NCF is based on a ring of touching or non-touching tubes surrounding the core ([Pryamikov et al., 2011](https://opg.optica.org/abstract.cfm?URI=oe-19-2-1441)). Core diameter, tube diameter, inter-tube distance, and tube wall thickness together control the spectral transmission bands, the attenuation level, the quality of higher-order mode suppression, and the sensitivity of the optical properties to bending. Attenuation levels < 0.07 dB/km and bending loss < 0.03 dB/m are reported ([Debord et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1364/OPTICA.4.000209)). Due to the minimal lattice structure and the reduced light interaction with the cladding structure, these fibers have very high damage thresholds and can even be used for very high laser energy delivery of up to 100 $\mu\textrm{J}$ peak power when the core is vacuum pumped to reduce nonlinear effects at these high powers ([Li et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijleo.2019.163093)). Negative curvature fibers are on the verge of being used in several applications such as laser micromachining and laser surgery. A recent study demonstrated the successful use of a custom HC-NCF with a transmission band of 600 – 830 nm at < 0.3 dB/m attenuation in the design of a handheld two-photon microscopy scanner for human skin autofluorescence ([Sherlock et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1002/jbio.201500290)).

## The used fiber

Together with [GLO Photonics](https://www.glophotonics.fr/) we developed a HC-NCF fiber whose optical characteristics appear to be ideally suited for laser delivery in the context of combined one- and two-photon light-sheet microscopy (![Figure 1](link_to_figure)). 

The outer fiber diameter is 200 ± 2 μm and the fiber coating diameter is 600 ± 30 μm. The fiber has an air-filled 30 μm-in-diameter core surrounded by a ring of eight non-contacting ~10 μm-in-diameter cladding tubes. In this so-called hypocycloid fiber structure, the negative curvature of the core contour is created by the tubes surrounding the core. Tube diameters, inter-tube distance, tube wall thickness, and core size together control the fiber transmission spectrum. They yield two broad transmission bands that are compatible with 1, 2, and 3P imaging, respectively (see ![Figure 1c](link_to_figure_c)): One in the near infrared from 700 - 1500 nm (I), and another in the visible spectrum from 400 - 535 nm (II). Within these spectral bands, the loss is less than 300 dB/km (corresponding to a transmission efficiency of more than 93% for a one-meter-long fiber), and the pulse dispersion is less than 1 dB/(km·nm) of spectral pulse width. 

The fiber is commercially available as a patch chord cable with standard FC/PC connectors. This proves extremely convenient as it allows one to disconnect and reconnect the fiber to the optical setup without the need for subsequent realignment on either end. The small core diameter compared to the large infrared wavelength further ensures near single-mode guidance.

The Gaussian beam properties of the laser are also well preserved at the fiber output with M^2 values of 1.23 and 1.18 that we measured at 1030 nm and 515 nm laser wavelength. The near field and far field profiles are symmetric with minimal ellipticity of 97.25% and 85.57%. The mode field diameters at 1/e^2 are 23 ± 1 μm and 26 ± 1 μm, respectively, which correspond to a fiber's numerical aperture (NA) of approximately 0.02. Due to negligible interactions between the light and the fiber material, the fiber exhibits a very high damage threshold: We could not observe any fiber damage up to the maximal tested peak powers of 40 μJ at 1030 nm and 10 μJ at 515 nm for 400 fs pulses, corresponding to an average laser power of 20W and 4W, respectively. These characteristics demonstrate that high-quality Gaussian beams can be delivered with this fiber across a broad spectral range with high transmission and low dispersion, which is a prerequisite for its application in high-resolution microscopy.

Using the fiber, we successfully transferered the broad spectrum of the espensive femtosecond laser source of a standard 2P setup installed on another optical table to our 2P light-sheet module with 98\% transmission efficiency and negligible dispersion. In addition, the optical fiber had an transmission band in the visible spectrum, allowing  that the same  light-sheet module to operated in one-photon mode, greatly simplifying laser alignment, laser safety and sample screening procedures.

Your paragraph goes here.
It will be commented out and won't be rendered.



 We developed a HC-NCF fiber whose  optical characteristics appear to be ideally suited for laser delivery in the context of one- and two-photon light-sheet microscopy (Figure \ref{fig:Compilation}). 
 The outer fiber diameter is 200 $\pm$ 2 \,$\mu$m and the fiber coating diameter is 600 $\pm$ 30\,$\mu$m. 
 The fiber has an air-filled 30\,$\mu$m-in-diameter core surrounded by a ring of eight non-contacting $\approx$ 10\,$\mu$m-in-diameter cladding tubes. In this so-called hypocycloid fiber structure, the negative curvature of the core contour is created by the tubes surrounding the core. Tube diameters, inter tube distance, tube wall thickness and core size together control the fiber transmission spectrum.  They yield two broad transmission bands that are compatible with 1, 2 and 3P imaging, respectively (see Figure \ref{fig:Compilation}c): One in the near infrared from 700 - 1500\,nm (I), another in the visible spectrum from 400 - 535\,nm (II). Within these spectral bands, loss is less than 300\,dB/km (corresponding to a transmission efficiency of more than 93\,\% for a one meter long fiber) and pulse dispersion is less than 1\,dB/(km·nm) of spectral pulse width.  The fiber is commercially available as patch chord cable with standard FC/PC connectors. This proves extremely convenient as it allows one to disconnect and reconnect the fiber to the optical setup without the need of a subsequent realignment on either end. 
 The small core diameter compared to the large infrared wavelength further ensures near single-mode guidance.
 Gaussian beam properties of the laser are also well preserved at the fiber output with M$^2$ values of 1.23 and 1.18 that we measured at 1030\,nm and 515\,nm laser wavelength. The near field and far field profiles are symmetric with minimal ellipticity of 97.25\,\% and 85.57\,\%. The mode field diameters at 1/$e^2$ are 23 $\pm$ 1 \,$\mu$m and 26 $\pm$ 1 \,$\mu$m respectively, which corresponded to a fibers numerical aperture of NA$\approx$0.02. Due to negligible interactions between the light and the fiber material the fiber exhibits a very high damage threshold: We could not observe any fiber damage up to the maximal tested peak powers of 40\,$\mu$J at 1030\,nm and 10\,$\mu$J at 515\,nm for 400\,fs pulses corresponding to an average laser power of 20W and 4W respectively. These characteristics demonstrate that high-quality Gaussian beams can be delivered with this fiber across a broad spectral range with high transmission and low dispersion, a prerequisite for its application in high resolution microscopy.
