# Hollow core fiber technology

Efficient, dispersion free and broadband fiber coupling of a two-photon laser source is a long-standing challenge in the field of two-photon microscopy ([Helmchen et al., 2011](http://cshprotocols.cshlp.org/content/2013/10/pdb.top078147.long)) and of fiber optics design ([Wang et al., 2013](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/high-power-laser-science-and-engineering/article/hollowcore-photonic-crystal-fibre-for-high-power-laser-beam-delivery/8D2851845D043DA937A93F431D9F9D9C)). The difficulty arises from the fact that standard single mode optical glass fibers are associated with strong linear and non-linear pulse dispersion, which reduces the two-photon efficiency. Pre-compensation methods are only efficient at low laser powers and are therefore impractical in the context of fast volumetric two-photon imaging, which requires high photonic fluxes. 

The development of single-mode photonic bandgap fibers, in which the light travels through an air filled hollow core, dramaticlly reduce dispersion and nonlinear effects and achieve transmission ratios greater than 50% ([Wang et al., 2013](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/high-power-laser-science-and-engineering/article/hollowcore-photonic-crystal-fibre-for-high-power-laser-beam-delivery/8D2851845D043DA937A93F431D9F9D9C), [Cregan et al., 1999](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.285.5433.1537)). These fibers have been successfully used for pulsed laser delivery in the context of multiphoton imaging ([Tai et al., 2004](https://opg.optica.org/abstract.cfm?URI=oe-12-25-6122), [Flusberg et al., 2005](https://opg.optica.org/abstract.cfm?URI=ol-30-17-2272), [Engelbrecht et al., 2008](https://opg.optica.org/abstract.cfm?URI=oe-16-8-5556), [Piyawattanametha et al,. 2009](https://opg.optica.org/abstract.cfm?&uri=ol-34-15-2309), [Choi et al., 2014](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep06626)). Howver, as the light guiding mechanism is based on the creation of an optical bandgap, these fibers only allow single wavelength transmission and are currently only commercially available for laser wavelength of 800 nm or 1064 nm (NTK photonics).  However, with the rapidly growing collections of genetically encoded actuators and sensors, broadband fiber delivery of the near infrared spectrum and optimally extended to visible wavelengths, is a prerequisite to take full advantage of 2P-LSFM in all possible applications while enabling laser source sharing between different setups.

Broadband fiber delivery spanning the visible and the near-infrared spectrum is possible with negative curvature hollow-core photonic crystal fibers (NCF), which do not rely on an optical bandgap for light-confinement ([Yu et al., 2016](https://opg.optica.org/abstract.cfm?URI=oe-24-12-12969), [Pryamikov et al., 2011](https://opg.optica.org/abstract.cfm?URI=oe-19-2-1441), [Yu et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.20.011153)). The simplest cross-sectional geometry of an NCF is based on a ring of touching or non-touching tubes surrounding the core ([Pryamikov et al., 2011](https://opg.optica.org/abstract.cfm?URI=oe-19-2-1441)). Core diameter, tube diameter, inter-tube distance and tube wall thickness together control the spectral transmission bands, the attenuation level, the quality of higher-order mode suppression and the sensitivity of the optical properties to bending. Attenuation levels < 0.07 dB/km and bending loss < 0.03 dB/m are reported ([Debord et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1364/OPTICA.4.000209)). Due to the minimal lattice structure and the reduced light interaction with the cladding structure, these fibers have very high damage thresholds and can even be used for very high laser energy delivery of up to 100 $\mu\textrm{J}$ peak power when the core is vacuum pumped to reduce nonlinear effects at these high powers ([Li et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijleo.2019.163093)).  Negative curvature fibers are on the verge of being used in several applications such as laser micromachining and laser surgery. A recent study demonstrated the successful use of a custom HC-NCF with a transmission band of 600 â€“ 830 nm at < 0.3 dB/m attenuation in the design of a handheld two-photon microscopy scanner for human skin autofluorescence ([Sherlock et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1002/jbio.201500290)).

Here, we present a negative curvature fiber with optimal optical properties for laser delivery for one- and two-photon fluorescence microscopy. We use this fiber to add a compact and low cost high speed two-photon digital scanning light-sheet unit to a commercially available electrophysiology scope from Scientifica. Using the fiber, we successfully transferered the broad spectrum of the espensive femtosecond laser source of a standard 2P setup installed on another optical table to our 2P light-sheet module with 98\% transmission efficiency and negligible dispersion. In addition, the optical fiber had an transmission band in the visible spectrum, allowing  that the same  light-sheet module to operated in one-photon mode, greatly simplifying laser alignment, laser safety and sample screening procedures.
