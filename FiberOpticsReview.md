Efficient, dispersion free and broadband fiber coupling of a two-photon laser sources is a long-standing challenge in the field of two-photon microscopy \cite{Helmchen:2013fs} and of fiber optics design \cite{Wang.2013}. The difficulty arises from the fact that standard single mode optical glass fibers are associated with strong linear and non-linear pulse dispersion reducing two photon efficiency. Precompensation methods are only efficient at low laser powers and are thus impractical in the context of fast volumetric two-photon imaging that requires high photonic fluxes. 

With the development of single-mode photonic band gap fibers, in which the light travels through an air filled hollow core, dispersion and non-linear effects can be dramatically reduced and transmission ratio can be larger than 50\,\% \cite{Wang.2013, Cregan:1999cm}. These fibers have been successfully used for pulsed laser delivery in multiphoton imaging contexts \cite{Tai:2004hc,Flusberg:05,Engelbrecht:2008ei,Piyawattanametha:09,Choi:2014fx}. But as the light guidance mechanism is based on the creation of an optical band gap, these fibers allow only single wavelength transmission and are currently only commercially available for 800nm or 1064nm laser wavelength (NTK photonics).  However, given the rapidly expanding collections of genetically encoded actuators and sensors, broadband fiber delivery of the near infrared spectrum and optimally extended to visible wavelengths, is a prerequisite to take full advantage of 2P-LSM in all possible applications while enabling laser source sharing between different setups.

Broadband fiber delivery spanning the visible and the near infrared spectrum is possible with negative curvature hollow-core photonic crystal fibers (NCF) that do not rely on an optical band gap for light-confinement \cite{Yu:16, Pryamikov:2011hi,Yu:2012eg}. The simplest cross section geometry of a NCF is based on a ring of touching or non-touching tubes surrounding the core (\cite{Pryamikov:2011hi}. Core diameter, tube diameter, inter-tube distance and tube wall thickness together control the spectral transmission bands, the attenuation level, the quality of higher-order mode suppression and the sensitivity of the optical properties to bending. Attenuation levels < 0.07\,dB/km and bending loss < 0.03\,dB/m are reported \cite{Debord:17}. Thanks to the minimal lattice structure and the reduced light interaction with the cladding structure, these fibers have very high damage thresholds and can be used even for very high laser energy delivery of up to 100$\mu$J peak power when the core is vacuum pumped to reduce non-linear effects at these high powers \cite{li2019high}.  Negative curvature fibers are on the verge of being used in several applications such as laser micromachining and laser surgery. A recent study demonstrated the successful use of a custom HC-NCF with a transmission band of 600 â€“ 830nm at < 0.3\,dB/m attenuation in the design of a handheld two-photon microscopy scanner of human skin autofluorescence \cite{Sherlock:2016fj}. 

Here, we present a negative curvature fiber with optimal optical properties for laser delivery for one- and two-photon fluorescence microscopy. We use this fiber to add a compact and low cost high speed two-photon digital scan light-sheet unit onto a commercial electrophysiology scope from Scientifica. With the fiber we successfully delivered the broad spectrum of the costly femtosecond laser source of a standard 2P setup installed on another optical table to our 2P light-sheet module with 98\,\% transmission efficiency and negligible dispersion. Furthermore, the optical fiber possessed an additional transmission band in the visible spectrum, so that the same  light-sheet module could also be operated in one-photon mode, thus greatly facilitating laser alignment, laser safety and sample screening procedures.
